### Project Euler ###
I have tried all the problems given, though in Project Euler#4 my problem was terminated due to timeout and i tried to workout for a different approach for a long time but i couldn't think of one,though my solution is correct.In Project Euler#1
I was getting wrong answer for very long integers as i was converting them to integers from float so approximations were wrong so i went into discussions and did one minor change and finally got the right answer
