# Task 7
# Rusted Email
I installed rust on Linux for this and then I learned some basic syntax required for Rust, after doing this I watched some videos about regex and learned how to make one for email
```
```
For Email we can have some no of words followed by "@" and then comes the various names like gmail or maybe outlook then we can have either ".com" or ".net" or".edu" in some cases so using this we can create a regex for this pattern.
# Task8
# Captcha Breaking
For this I searched how to do this task and then i came to know that for interpreting text from image we need tesseract-OCR and then i installed it using pip command and i also installed the 'pillow' module and then i converted the string into a list and then further solved the problem and got the final thing.

# Task13
# Project Euler
I have tried all the problems given, though in Project Euler#4 my problem was terminated due to timeout and i tried to workout for a different approach for a long time but i couldn't think of one,though my solution is correct.In Project Euler#1
I was getting wrong answer for very long integers as i was converting them to integers from float so approximations were wrong so i went into discussions and did one minor change and finally got the right answer
