# Task3
# Web Scraping Using Ruby
I am not getting correct url but I am getting other details
# Task4
# Advanced XOR
 I have tried the task and i corrected the xor_adv.py code and i also tried to write a decoding file but my decoder is not correct and i am not sure how to approach further.
# Task 5
# Get it Using Javascript
Status:Done
I have done the task successfully and i am getting the details of a person by entering a username.
# Task 6
# CLI App Using Go
I have successfully got the followers and no of followers.Note that max no of followers i can get is 200 so there is chance of followers more than 200 in Twitter API maximum limit is 200 so i can not get beyond that.I used sources like go-twiiter, twitter api documentation etc.
# Task 7
# Rusted Email
I installed rust on Linux for this and then I learned some basic syntax required for Rust, after doing this I watched some videos about regex and learned how to make one for email
```
```
For Email we can have some no of words followed by "@" and then comes the various names like gmail or maybe outlook then we can have either ".com" or ".net" or".edu" in some cases so using this we can create a regex for this pattern.
# Task8
# Captcha Breaking
For this I searched how to do this task and then i came to know that for interpreting text from image we need tesseract-OCR and then i installed it using pip command and i also installed the 'pillow' module and then i converted the string into a list and then further solved the problem and got the final thing.
# Task9
# Setup a simple personal website.
```
```
I did Not use any of the Starter Files given in the links and i made my own website using some basic html and css
# Task 10
# CS50
```
```
I have watched till week-4 but i have not started with any of the weeks.
# Task11
# A pong game
I have done the task with the help of youtube videos by understanding about various things like how ball shoud react when it hits  paddle or a wall and how should i change the direction when the ball hits the paddle or user.The main principle used here is of collision.
# Task12
# Python Source
I just went in the reverse order and tried decoding the ciphertext after getting the pattern in the reverse_me.py.I think the file name was the biggest clue!
# Task13
# Project Euler
I have tried all the problems given, though in Project Euler#4 my problem was terminated due to timeout and i tried to workout for a different approach for a long time but i couldn't think of one,though my solution is correct.In Project Euler#1
I was getting wrong answer for very long integers as i was converting them to integers from float so approximations were wrong so i went into discussions and did one minor change and finally got the right answer
