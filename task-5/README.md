### Get it Using Javascript ###
I have done the task successfully and i am getting the details of a person by entering a username.Here I came to know that I am not using Graphql but i am getting everything correct.I tried once more with GraphQl though I know how to get the name and all after learning something but I am not able to get how to import these graphql features in JavaScript file.I am sorry.
